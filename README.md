# Text Analysis and Word Cloud Generation from PDF

This project involves extracting and analyzing text from a PDF document, generating a word cloud, and performing sentiment analysis. The script reads a PDF file, extracts text from all pages, and then creates a word cloud to visualize word frequencies. It also performs sentiment analysis to gauge the overall tone of the text.

## Key Features:
- **PDF Text Extraction:** Used `PyPDF2` to read and extract text from a PDF document.
- **Word Cloud Generation:** Created a word cloud with custom stopwords to visualize word frequencies using the WordCloud library.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzed the sentiment of the extracted text using TextBlob to determine overall polarity.
- **Page Extraction:** Extracted text from specific pages within the PDF for focused analysis.

## Key Skills:
- **Programming:** Python (`PyPDF2`, `TextBlob`, `WordCloud`, `Matplotlib`)
- **Text Extraction:** Extracting text from PDF files
- **Data Visualization:** Generating and displaying word clouds
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing text sentiment using TextBlob

## Python Libraries:
- **PyPDF2** (`from PyPDF2 import PdfReader`)
  - For reading and manipulating PDF files
- **TextBlob** (`from textblob import TextBlob`)
  - For natural language processing, including sentiment analysis and text processing
- **WordCloud** (`from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator`)
  - For generating and visualizing word clouds from text data
- **Matplotlib** (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)
  - For data visualization and plotting
